              What I can bring to the table is a deep understanding in Object Oriented Programming,HTML/CSS,  javascript, typescript, MongoDB and Firebase. 
              I also have experience in python, R, and the agile development workflow from my past internships and classes.
              
              I am a fast learner, especially when I come to develop a passion for the subject. My favorite method of learning is pair programming as we can not only share and exchange our knowledge but also create a sense of understanding and comradeship. 
              One of my strengths is having the ability to recognize who is best at doing what while working in a team environment and I often use that intuition to maximize efficiency and productivity.
